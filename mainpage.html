	<h3>Hi! Welcome to my web page!</h3>

<p>This is a place for calm, comfort, relaxation, and general stress and anxiety relief.
	Sometimes people just need to get away from life for a bit and escape, so
	I wanted to provide a few of my favourite ways to de stress here.</p>
<p>On the left, you will find a few pages with different types of stress relief.</p>
<p>The first page is a list of recipes that I found. Why not try something new from this list?</p>
<p>The second page has a cute and wise kitten to lighten your spirits and encouraging
	or inspiring quotes to get you through the day</p>
<p>The third page is a fun drawing pad you can use to create some art and
	 then save it to your computer.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy using my web page and I hope it helps you feel less stressed in your busy life.
